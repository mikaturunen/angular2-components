# Github pages specific files

This directory contains files specific for the gh-pages branch. Like specific styling, highlight.js and other
bits and pieces of tools that we are going to staticly need in the mikaturunen.github.io/angular2-components.

This means we cannot get the through npm, bower or other means. We unfortunately have to include them into the repo itself in the specific gh-pages branch.

## List of files

* gh-pages.css - Styling of the index.html and the general overall look of the component gallery.
* highlight.pack.css and .js - Styling and functionality for highlight.js that properly displays the `<pre>` tag markdown for components TypeScript
